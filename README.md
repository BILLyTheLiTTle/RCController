# RCController

This is the controller which runs on Android and it is responsible to send actions to RCCar (https://github.com/BILLyTheLiTTle/RCCar) and get some feedback from it. Of course you are forced to use this controller. You are free to create your own controller or modify the rc car in order to respond to the controller you want.
